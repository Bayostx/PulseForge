# PulseForge
## Milestone-Powered Decentralized Crowdfunding

PulseForge is an innovative decentralized crowdfunding protocol built on the Stacks blockchain where fund release is conditional on milestone achievements. Unlike traditional crowdfunding platforms, PulseForge ensures accountability through a milestone-based voting system that protects both creators and backers.

## üöÄ Features

- **Milestone-Based Funding**: Campaign funds are released incrementally as creators complete predefined milestones
- **Democratic Voting System**: Backers vote to approve milestone completion before funds are released
- **Refundable Escrow**: STX tokens are held in escrow and can be refunded if campaigns fail to deliver
- **Transparent Progress Tracking**: Real-time visibility into campaign progress and milestone status
- **Creator Protection**: Anti-spam measures and proper validation ensure legitimate campaigns
- **Backer Protection**: Vote-based approval system prevents fund misuse

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contract Components

- **Campaign Management**: Create and manage crowdfunding campaigns with customizable parameters
- **Milestone System**: Define time-based or deliverable milestones with voting requirements
- **Voting Mechanism**: Democratic approval system for milestone completion
- **Escrow System**: Secure STX token holding and conditional release
- **Refund System**: Automatic refund capability for failed campaigns

### Core Functions
