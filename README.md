# PulseForge
## Milestone-Powered Decentralized Crowdfunding with Multi-Token Support

PulseForge is an innovative decentralized crowdfunding protocol built on the Stacks blockchain where fund release is conditional on milestone achievements. Unlike traditional crowdfunding platforms, PulseForge ensures accountability through a milestone-based voting system that protects both creators and backers. **Now supports both STX and SIP-010 fungible tokens for maximum flexibility.**

## üöÄ Features

- **Milestone-Based Funding**: Campaign funds are released incrementally as creators complete predefined milestones
- **Multi-Token Support**: Support for both STX and approved SIP-010 fungible tokens
- **Democratic Voting System**: Backers vote to approve milestone completion before funds are released
- **Refundable Escrow**: Tokens are held in escrow and can be refunded if campaigns fail to deliver
- **Transparent Progress Tracking**: Real-time visibility into campaign progress and milestone status
- **Creator Protection**: Anti-spam measures and proper validation ensure legitimate campaigns
- **Backer Protection**: Vote-based approval system prevents fund misuse
- **Token Registry**: Curated list of approved SIP-010 tokens for secure campaign creation

## üìñ Usage

### Creating an STX Campaign

```clarity
(contract-call? .pulseforge create-stx-campaign

(contract-call? .pulseforge create-token-campaign 
  "DeFi Innovation Hub" 
  "Revolutionary DeFi platform development" 
  u500000000 ;; Target amount in token units
  u2160      ;; Duration: ~15 days in blocks
  'SP3FBR2AGK5H9QBDH3EEN6DF8EK8JY7RX8QJ5SVTE.some-token)
```

### Adding Milestones

```clarity
(contract-call? .pulseforge add-milestone 
  u1 ;; campaign-id
  "Complete MVP development" 
  u720  ;; Target block (~5 days)
  u10)  ;; Required votes
```

### Backing Campaigns

#### STX Campaign
```clarity
(contract-call? .pulseforge back-stx-campaign u1 u100000) ;; 100 STX
```

## ü™ô Supported Tokens

### STX (Native)
- **Always supported**: STX is the native token of the Stacks blockchain
- **No approval needed**: STX campaigns can be created immediately

### SIP-010 Fungible Tokens
- **Approval required**: SIP-010 tokens must be approved by the contract owner before use
- **Security focused**: Only vetted tokens are approved to ensure campaign safety
- **Check approval status**: Use `is-token-approved` to verify token status

### Token Approval Process
1. Contract owner reviews token contract for security and legitimacy
2. Owner calls `approve-token` with the token contract principal
3. Token becomes available for campaign creation
4. Creators can now use the approved token for campaigns

## üß™ Testing

The contract includes comprehensive error handling and validation:

- Parameter validation for all inputs
- Access control for campaign creators and contract owner
- Token type validation and approval checks
- Anti-spam measures for voting
- Proper escrow management for both STX and SIP-010 tokens
- Edge case handling for refunds
- Token transfer error handling

## üîí Security Features

- **Token Approval System**: Only pre-approved SIP-010 tokens can be used
- **Type Safety**: Clear separation between STX and SIP-010 token operations
- **Transfer Validation**: Comprehensive error handling for token transfers
- **Access Control**: Proper authorization checks for all sensitive operations
- **Anti-Spam Protection**: Voting and backing restrictions prevent abuse
